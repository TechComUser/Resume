# Purpose
This readme will explain how to host a website on GitHub Pages for the purpose of technical documentation so you can build a website like this:

All in just a few minutes.
# Prerequisites
- A free GitHub account
- GitHub Desktop or another Git client
- A text editor: I recommend Visual Studio Code or Typora
- Markdown knowledge: see [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for more detail
- A resume or other text doc- [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)ument formatted in Markdown
# Hosting a Site on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages allows you to host a lightweight website, for free! All it takes is a GitHub account and just a little bit of knowledge. Setting up a website usually takes a lot of effort and technical know-how; GitHub Pages sites can be up in a matter of minutes.

GitHub Pages is best-suited for very small websites, such as a personal website or a small blog. It runs off of **Jekyll**, which is a *static site generator*. Andrew Etter recommends using static site generators for technical documentation because they are very quick to set up, have little technical overhead, and are well-suited for small applications like this.

## Step 1. Create a repository
Navigate to your [GitHub home page](https://github.com) and create a new repository by clicking the green "New" button on the left-hand page. This is where the code for our site will live. 

Using a site like GitHub allows us to utilize *distributed version control*. Etter recommends using services like GitHub for technical documentation because they perform well, allow you to work on files without internet access, and allow multiple people to work on the same file.

## Step 2. Clone your repository
In GitHub Desktop, navigate to "Repository" in the top row and click "Clone Repository". There, you will be able to see the repository you just created. Cloning the repo simply means that you will be able to store and access your site's files on your computer.

## Step 3. Create your index.md
GitHub pages will *build* your site based on what you put in your repository. The main page will be named "index.md" - this is the page that all the people that first go to your site will first see. Open up your favourite text editor and open your new repo and create your front page.

Why .md? This is a Markdown file, which is a lightweight *markup language*. Etter recommends using such a language because they are human-readable - anyone without technical experience can read and understand a Markdown file just fine.

## Step 4. Push to GitHub and enable Pages
On GitHub Desktop, stage all your changes and push to Main. On the GitHub website, navigate to your repo's page and click on "settings", then "Pages". Then, enable GitHub Pages. You're done!

# FAQ

## Why should I use Markdown over a traditional word processor?
In Word, Google Docs, or other word processors, you need to format your text as you write it. You have a lot of options for font size, colour, layout and so on. This might be great if you're just making a pamphlet or a one-page document, but it becomes really excessive depending on the amount of material you need to go through.

Markdown allows you to focus first on the *content* of what you're producing, rather than making it look good right away. You can let your automated tools handle that for you.
